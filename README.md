The SQL queries are mainly written for PostgreSQL database and can also be applied to any other major type of SQL database. 
Some of the SQL scripts here use "dvdrenter.tar" which you need to restore or load first before running each query in a script.
In each script, there are some queries that are separated by a line of dashes in a paragraph; each one of them is commented out except the last one. So to run them, you will need to uncomment them.
